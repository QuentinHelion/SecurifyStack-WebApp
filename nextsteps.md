## **📊 JSON-Only Data Storage Strategy**

### **🎯 Decision: JSON Files for All Data Storage**

**Rationale:**
- **Simplified architecture** - no database setup/maintenance
- **LDAPS integration** - user management handled externally
- **Version control friendly** - JSON files can be tracked in Git
- **Easy backup/restore** - simple file operations
- **Human-readable** - easy to debug and understand
- **Minimal dependencies** - no database server required

### **📁 File Structure**

```
/data/
├── public/           # Non-sensitive data (readable by app)
│   ├── machines.json
│   └── security_events.json
├── private/          # Sensitive data (encrypted)
│   ├── system_config.json.enc
│   ├── ldaps_cache.json.enc
│   └── audit_logs.json.enc
└── backups/          # Encrypted backups
    └── backup_20250115_103000.tar.gz.enc

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 /data/private/*.enc
chmod 644 /data/public/*.json
chown securifystack:securifystack /data/private/
```

## **🔒 JSON-Only Security & Best Practices**

### **✅ Advantages of JSON-Only Approach**

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No database setup/maintenance required
2. **LDAPS Integration**: Centralized user management through existing LDAPS
3. **Version Control**: JSON files can be versioned in Git (with proper security)
4. **Backup Simplicity**: Easy to backup and restore JSON files
5. **No Database Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface and complexity
6. **Human-Readable**: Easy to debug and understand data structure

### **⚠️ Security Best Practices**

**File Encryption Strategy:**
- **Sensitive files encrypted**: `system_config.json`, `ldaps_cache.json`, `audit_logs.json`
- **Public files unencrypted**: `machines.json`, `security_events.json`
- **Automatic encryption/decryption** with Fernet (symmetric encryption)

**LDAPS Sync Strategy:**
- **Regular sync** (every 30 minutes) from LDAPS to local cache
- **Group-to-role mapping** for permissions
- **Automatic user deactivation** when removed from LDAPS
- **Encrypted cache storage** for user data

### **🎯 When JSON Files Are Appropriate**

**✅ Good Use Cases:**
- Small to medium datasets (< 10,000 records)
- Read-heavy workloads
- Simple data structures
- When you want to avoid database complexity
- When data needs to be version-controlled
- When you have existing LDAPS infrastructure

**❌ Consider Database When:**
- Large datasets (> 10,000 records)
- Complex queries and relationships
- High write frequency
- Need for ACID transactions
- Complex data analytics

### **🔧 Implementation Recommendations**

1. **Use Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive JSON files (config, users, audit logs)
2. **Regular Backups**: Automated encrypted backups
3. **LDAPS Sync**: Regular sync with LDAPS for user data
4. **File Validation**: Validate JSON structure on read/write
5. **Atomic Writes**: Use temporary files for safe writes
6. **Access Control**: Proper file permissions and ownership
7. **Monitoring**: Monitor file integrity and sync status
8. **Concurrency Control**: Implement file locking for write operations

### **📊 Performance Considerations**

**JSON Files:**
- ✅ Fast for small datasets (< 1,000 records)
- ✅ Simple setup and maintenance
- ✅ Easy backup and restore
- ❌ Slow for large datasets or complex queries
- ❌ Poor concurrency (file locking issues)
- ❌ No built-in data validation

### **🔒 Security Considerations**

**JSON Files:**
- ✅ Easy to encrypt individual files
- ✅ Simple backup/restore
- ✅ Version control friendly
- ❌ No built-in access control
- ❌ Manual data validation
- ❌ File corruption risks

### **📈 Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: JSON-Only Implementation**
- Start with JSON files for all data
- Implement encryption for sensitive files
- Set up LDAPS integration
- Create backup and sync procedures

**Phase 2: Monitor and Optimize**
- Monitor file sizes and performance
- Implement file locking for concurrency
- Add data validation and integrity checks
- Optimize backup and sync processes

**Phase 3: Scale if Needed**
- If data grows beyond 10,000 records
- If concurrency becomes an issue
- If complex queries are needed
- Consider migration to database

## **🚀 Implementation Priority**

### **High Priority (Phase 1)**
- User attribution in deployed machines with detailed metadata
- Basic role-based access control with LDAPS integration
- Admin user management interface with bulk operations
- Machine ownership tracking and transfer functionality
- Enhanced security with TOTP two-factor authentication

### **Medium Priority (Phase 2)**
- Wazuh integration with dashboard embedding
